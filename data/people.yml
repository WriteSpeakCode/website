  bio: promotes social innovation while helping coders improve their skills.
    CodeMontage was born out of the belief that computing is the most efficient 
    way to improve the human experience, and that software developers become the 
    best through lots of practice building real applications. We know from teaching 
    beginners that there’s a frustrating gap between learning to code and being 
    able to build robust applications, and we know from hiring and mentoring 
    developers that experience can’t be replaced with canned tutorials.

       chance to be heard, and to shape society and the world. Working with top 
       universities, foundations, think tanks, nonprofits, corporations and 
       community organizations, we scout and train under-represented experts to 
       take thought leadership positions in their fields; we connect them with 
       our national network of high-level media mentors; and we vet and channel 
       the best new experts and ideas directly to media gatekeepers who need them, 
       across all platforms.  The OpEd Project is an
