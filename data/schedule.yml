    talk_description: In our highly-interactive, energetic full-day seminar we explore the 
        source of credibility and how to establish it; how to present ideas 
        quickly and powerfully under pressure; the components of powerful, 
        evidence-based argument; the difference between being “right” and being 
        effective; and strategies for making a greater impact, including how to 
        escape a pigeonhole, how to preach beyond the choir, and the value of 
        seeing your argument as part of a bigger picture—and yourself as part of 
        a larger public conversation.  Participants leave with a draft op-ed in 
        hand.
